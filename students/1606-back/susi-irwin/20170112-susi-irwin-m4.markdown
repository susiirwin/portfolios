# Susi Irwin - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This module my main goal is to further prepare myself for my new career in software development. I want to use Agile to develop the project to which I have been assigned. I want to be a contributing member of the class, the team, and the Community. I was to learn JavaScript and jQuery well enough to feel comfortable with the vocabulary to continue my learning post-Turing. I want to graduate Turing.

Needed for Satisfactory Progress:
- Add title to javascript url filtering
- Doesn't require password confirmation
- Links don't seem to be scoped to users
- Doesn't have flash messages on create ajax
- Mark as unread also adds to read count on hotreads
- And edit

^^^^^ These things have been satisfactorily fixed

### Scores

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

### 5. User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 6. Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Personal Experience:

#####  - Learning React

Learning React was both challenging and fun. ReactBox was awesome. The lessons were super straight forward and easy to follow. I love the ideas of components and working with pieces of functionality on a page - feels a lot like asp.net forms in SharePoint (so, familiar). I am excited to learn more and to use Lovissa's Creact tutorial to really dig in. As a team, we have a spike branch to get our feet wet with React in an actual project. I talk more about learning React in my [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@susi27/a-backender-reacting-to-react-2ee0dbcc1e87#.8dicf9mu8).

#####  - Overall
This project has been pretty amazing overall. We were given a brownfield project with not a ton of functionality built in and basically a brainstormed list of what Jeff would like to see in the application by the end of the 6 weeks. We also, as a team, brainstormed some of our own ideas for features that we, as users of the system, thought would be awesome to have included. We were to use Agile methodologies to progress through three, 2 week sprints with Andrew as our Scrum Master/Tech Lead. I have used Agile and been a part of scrums and sprints in my previous career, but not as a developer, so I was really excited to see how that side of the desk would be. It was more frustrating than I anticipated, but I think that was due to a few specific factors:

* Lack of clear directives about the sprint as a whole
* Miscommunication about what sprint planning and card assignments

Our application is a Company and Job finding and reviewing application. We were originally tasked with using the data from a PDF of over 2500 companies to basically seed the database. As we got into the first sprint and saw the content that was included, we started questioning the effectiveness of including that data. Eventually, the team created 12 examples of the types of companies and information we would like to see in the application. This POC, along with a meeting with Lia to discuss our thoughts with her, was enough to show the Tech Leads why we felt the way we did. The app is up and running and includes those 12 companies. The app is basically crowd-sourced; students will log in and begin populating the database with companies and contact information. Any logged in user can add notes to a company page. Users can star companies and save them to their own profile as well. Our service in this app is a previously worked on Scale Up project called "Looking For" that allows students and alumni to search job postings. The overall goal our team has in mind (for future modules) is that Monocle is a one stop shop for Job Hunting resources and tracking.

I think one of the biggest hurdles we faced as a team was understanding the expectations set on us each sprint. My understanding of Sprint Planning has always been that cards are created and assigned during Sprint planning and those cards are to be completed within the sprint timeframe - in our case, 2 weeks. There were a few times where this was not what was asked of us and that made things confusing. Also, I was more used to demo-ing at the end of a sprint and not twice - once being in the middle, the second at the end.

That being said, there was a lot of AWESOME that happened within out project. I noticed that we mainly paired on tasks since the bulk of our sprints 2 and 3 were JavaScript focused and all 4 of us were pretty new to the language. We came in on weekends, talked via Github and Slack, and really made the effort to communicate tasks and progress. As a team, we never really stormed, which was pretty great, and when we were "performing", we were really moving along. The team stayed focused and realistic about abilities, timeframes, and deliverables as best as we could.

The main part of the project that I am proud of and excited about is the JavaScript Notes for companies. This was a long, very long, tedious set of cards for Dan and me. This took us more than 1 sprint to accomplish (it was all due for Sprint 2), but we hit a lot of snags - mainly the fact that we had a few lessons in JavaScript and were trying to implement it as we went. I know that this was probably one of the more realistic "real world" scenarios for us in this project so although it was frustrating, it was also pretty amazing. We knew that our code left a lot to be desired, but we had no idea how buggy it truly was until we started messing with it in staging and production. It was an eye opener for us. We had to sit down, go back through all of the JavaScript we had written and really just dig our teeth into it to see what was going on, where it was breaking, and what we needed to do to fix it. And... we got it. Such an amazing feeling! Our ajax calls were firing, we were persisting data to the database, we could show a note's author and allow a note owner (or admin) to edit and delete notes. In Rails this was a no brainer for us - we had it working in no time, but JS was a different story and it was a difficult one. It feels really good to squash those bugs.

#### Feedback to me:
From Nate: "Susi, it was so much fun to work with you again on a project. You keep everyone involved and engaged and are just a fantastic team member in general. Your inquisitive nature helps me to clarify things I might not have even realized I was somewhat confused about myself. Watching how much you have grown as a developer in the last 7 months has been amazing to watch. Your contributions to this project were immense and I can't wait to see what you do in the future at Granicus and beyond."

From Dan: "Susi, it has been a pleasure working with you again.  Weâ€™ve had to work together on some really tough challenges.  Your attitude and perseverance make all the difference in moving things forward.  Even when we were struggling through implementing javascript, jQuery, and AJAX for the first time in our project, we kept at it and kept moving forward trying different ideas and taking turns driving.  It was a tough pairing session but ultimately very rewarding when we finally got it.  You donâ€™t give up and show a lot of grit.  Iâ€™m lucky to have had you in my cohort and Iâ€™ve really enjoyed getting to know you and work with you."

From Brendan: "Working on Monocle with you has been a fantastic experience.  Your drive and excitement when something works always carries through. You have a fantastic sense for how to translate airy requirements in to user stories and keep the pivotal tracker in shape. After working with you in the past, I really noticed that you are getting more confident in your work. It was really cool to see you plowing through difficult problems and defending your code. You don't seem like you will ever let your knowledge go stale, so I really look forward to seeing what you manage to do after Turing."

#### Feedback from me:
Nate Anderson: "Nate, your analytical nature makes you such a pleasure to work with on projects and specifically on Monocle. You are not afraid to ask the tough questions of the Tech Lead, the Team, or the application itself. It is an absolute blast to work through problems with you. You have a knack of looking at the code and the problems from a different angle that I don't see. Your keen sense and intuition are incredible. Your work on Monocle has been outstanding."

Brendan Dillon: "It has been such an amazing pleasure to get to work with you on this project. Your ability to look at a problem, break it down into super small, reasonable parts is second to none. I am in awe at your abilities with JavaScript and jQuery. No card given to you ever seemed to fluster you in the slightest. I hope to gain some of your confidence and curiosity as I move away from Turing. Your calm approach to programming verges on Zen and is extremely commendable."

Dan Broadbent: "You stepped up on day 1 and offered to PM the project. Kudos to you for that! I admire your ability to stand up for your opinions to the tech leads and present the facts as you seem them, back them up with evidence and present your case. You never get emotional about it, you simply state what you know, what you see, and your proposed outcome. You have amazing communication skills both written and spoken. You present yourself in a professional manner but still know how to sit back and joke around when the timing is right. Pairing with you on the Notes section of the project was great. Thank you for trusting me to struggle through some bugs and knowing when to step in and offer guidance and support. You are a natural leader and it was great working with you again."

### The Process

I am still working on my fakers. I have dug into the code very deeply and have a better understanding of what is happening. My tests are moving along but not passing at this point. My passes were premature when I submitted my PR, but I had no real way to know that until it was reviewed by another contributor. I am in conversation with that person now. I am VERY excited but know this will be a long process.

Feedback from Nate Anderson:

"Overall impressions:

I can feel your energy through the article. It's pretty amazing. Most of these technical articles are very boring and dry,
yours makes me want to continue to read to see what happened next.

Structure & Formatting:

It flowed very well. Not too long, not too short. I like the snippet where we get to see some of the syntax to get a taste
of what you were dealing with.

Grammar & Syntax:

I did not find any grammar or syntax errors. I might have missed some but I think you did a great job here.

Final Words:

This was a very unique article to me in that the subject was not all that exciting by itself, but you did a great job of
creating a feel that contributing to open source is the most exciting thing in the world. I wish more authors of these types
of articles would take a little bit more time to create a more personal feel and I think you nailed it in this aspect. While
also providing useful information."

* Feedback/Review from Sonia Gupta: "There is a minor typo in the first paragraph, it should say "components as reusable objects." I like the bag analogy you use, it's very approachable. Drawing similarities with HTML also makes the reader more comfortable, and your enthusiastic narration is fun to read!"

## F: Community

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions (Group 3)
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group3.md)

This was an amazing small group (4 person) discussion. Oddly enough there were 3 people with red hair so we had discussions about being a red head in this world and how sometimes comments that are hysterical jokes to the speaker are fairly offensive to us. We spoke about where we think these comments and reactions stem from and what we can do to really work to alleviate them all together. It was a pretty heavy discussion, but it felt really great to hear from my group and chat about things like this.

#### Journey Mapping
* [Original Gear Up Outline]()

My group loved this session. We decided to take a less technical approach to the journey mapping and instead mapped the user experience of a person playing Monopoly. At first it seemed like we were a little too far off topic, but honestly after the first few minutes of questions, it turned into a very serious discussion about users make decisions based on the information at hand. Our map included the 3 main areas and the discussions were around how these areas affected application design: chance (rolling dice), strategy, and completion. The drawing at the end was not as helpful to me as the actual discussion but I do think that a few members of the team really enjoyed the visual aspect of the discussion.

#### Grit Mindset
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I had heard of this before, but never really dug into it. It was a great session to have at the end of the Module especially as a Module 4 student heading into my first Software Development role in just a few weeks. It really made me reflect on WHY I decided to come to Turing and give up my previous career. It also made me think long and hard about how Grit is not always a good thing - how sometimes it can lead to unhealthy behaviors. I have seen in myself and others the Grit taking over and things outside of our focus falling too far to the wayside. When all focus is directed on this one goal, does anything else suffer? Does anyONE else suffer? Do we has the Gritty person suffer? One idea we discussed in our group along with the idea I just mentioned was failing fast if one is to fail. What we meant by this, is that it would be better to fail quickly versus spending months, years on a passion that just isn't right for us. There is a lot of self-awareness that needs to come alongside Grit and I think finding and striking that balance is not only extremely important, but absolutely crucial.

## G: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* Bailey Ward - "I have been so, so fortunate to be matched up with Bailey as she entered Turing this module. Bright, hardworking, empathetic and just all around amazing, Bailey brings with her the grit to accomplish whatever she puts her mind toward."

* Chelsea Skovgaard - "Chelsea - you are such a force at Turing. Getting to know you at JSC and Friday Guest Speakers has been a highlight of this module. Your positive attitude, eagerness to learn, and general kindness is truly what makes our community what it is. You are always there with words of encouragement, a hug when needed, a cup of the truth when that is needed as well. Chelsea, you are such an asset to the development world and I cannot wait to watch you take it by storm!"

* MaryJane Valade - "She probably doesn't know this, but MaryJane has been one of my inspirations at Turing since I met her. Her confidence and sense of self is so commendable and I strive to be as self assured as she is. She stays calm and collected, can carefully and articulately communicate her thoughts and opinions, and knows how to get the job done. She is a rock star and I am so excited to move into the "real world" of development with her!"

* Raphael Barbo - "Rapha has always been one to stop, listen, and check in with me. He has been a constant supporter of every student at Turing whom he has come in contact with. His positive attitude and cheery mood is not to be missed around Turing! Rapha keeps his head on his shoulders but dreams big - in his code and in life in general. I am so excited to see where Rapha takes his talent and the applications that he will develop."

### Receiving Feedback

* From Chelsea Skovgaard - "I was lucky enough the meet Susi during my first module at Turing during the Joan Clarke coffee mornings and in the Pahlka posse. I also have had the pleasure of interacting with her during Gear Ups and Lunch Roulette over the following modules. Susi is one of the most open, graceful, and kind-hearted people I have met. She can't help but make you smile when she talks. She made Turing feel welcoming and gave me confidence as a fellow female developer. I also appreciate how Susi always speaks her mind while being willing to listen. Susi is a wonderful colleague, friend, and developer who contributes to the community and inspires others."

* From MaryJane Valade - "I couldn't be more proud of Susi for her perseverance to finish the program even though she already scored a job. She is driven to succeed for herself and her family. Her enthusiasm seems to rub off on those around her and she has become a great friend. I wish we could have done a project together, combining our FE and BE skills."

* From Raphael Barbo - "Susi is one of the most resilient and self-motivated people I have had the opportunity to work with. Her dedication throughout her time at Turing has been nothing short of remarkable, and it has paid off big time. Susi has certainly become a great software developer, and I am glad to have been able to share this journey with her."

* From Bailey Ward - "Susi was a wonderful introduction to Turing. As my pre-work guide we got together before classes even began and she spent time calming my nerves and answering my questions. Susi helped me get settled into the flow of things and really made me feel at home. She is the sweetest, most positive person I have ever had the chance to work around. I know she will brighten up each place that is lucky enough to get her."

### Being a Community Member and Playing a Part

Try Turing - I have participated in two Try Turing Panels and have really enjoyed sharing my story with potential students. I enjoy talking about my school and my community. It is an amazing feeling to have someone walk up to me the first week of the module and tell me that I was part of their decision to apply to Turing. It gives me goosebumps to think that I might have had a part in helping someone else make this huge decision to change their life.

Pre-work guide (x3) - I have had the pleasure of being a Pre-work guide for 3 students (1610, 1611, and 1701). It has been humbling to answer questions, be vulnerable when I don't know answers, be honest about my experience, and watch these women coming into Turing and embrace the challenge. My 1610 and 1611 students are shining stars and I know after my Google Hangout conversation with my 1701 student that she is just as amazing.

SAB member (2 modules) - I have been on SAB for two modules and have really enjoyed my time representing 1606 Backend for those 12 weeks. I consider myself very lucky to be on the board and to be able to interact with representatives from the other 7 cohorts. Being so close to inner workings of Turing, attending Staff Retros, helping to shape the community has really been eye opening for me. Turing is a complicated place and it takes many, many people all working hand in hand to keep it running; SAB has given me the opportunity to see how this all comes together. Co-leading our cohort retros has been both great and intimidating all at the same time. Standing in front of my peers each week, reading their anonymous words in surveys and attempting to represent them to the best of my ability has been wonderful.

Imposters Lunch -
Imposters has gone through many changes since I started attending in Module 1. When I stepped up as a co-lead I helped shape it to be more of a coping session than a venting session. We actively spoke about how we can deal with feeling like an imposter, build up some tools for our "toolbox" to help with this, and support each other in our individual journeys.

Lunch Roulette - I have been a firm believer in Lunch Roulettes since Module 1. I think they are super important to the health and well-being of students because we are socializing and not sitting in front of our code. We are talking and chit-chatting and finding out about our Turing-mates. I think over the course of my 7 months at Turing I have only skipped 3 Lunch Roulettes and 2 of those were due to SAB. I was almost always the person initiating the group each week and always left it open brown bag or going out. I loved these lunches and the culture that they created.

Joan Clarke Society - This group has been so inspiring for me and has really allowed me to get to know some amazing women. Each Tuesday we met at Common Grounds (RIP) and just talked. Sometimes there was some impromptu pairing, but mostly it was good company. The slack channel has been super important as well, but the face to face interactions have been the best.

Guest Speakers - I have attended and enjoyed every guest speaker during my 7 months at Turing. I have always found them interesting and inspiring. My favorite was the man from Democracy now talking about Micro-services. It was something that, at the time, I had no idea about and was an awesome segue into the next week when Jeff taught us about them. Having that base lecture from our guest speaker made the concept a little less abstract for me - though still difficult.

### Mentor Relationships throughout Turing

* Matt Rogers (Teladoc) and Mark Miranda (1602)

I wanted to add a section to mention how important my mentors have been to my success at Turing.

Mark was my pre-work guide for Turing. Little did I know we would get closer and become friends over the course of the last 7 months. We speak regularly, our families hang out, and I can always count on him for guidance, advice, and a reality check. He is a role model if there ever was one for a coder. Even though Mark is not my official Turing Mentor, he truly is one of my mentors.

Matt agreed to take me on as a mentee during week 3 of Module 1. I was nervous to have a mentor who was not in the Denver area, but Matt being in Dallas has not been an issue at all. Holding remote sessions has helped with my git workflow, my screen hero sessions, my overall communication. Matt has had complete faith in me since day 1. He is always there to ask me the hard questions and encourage me to finish what I start as well as I possibly can, and then some.

Matt and Mark both know what I am capable of and hold me to that standard. They challenge me and help me celebrate my wins. They have both been there for me through some of my hardest spots in Turing and I am absolutely sure that I would be not be submitting this portfolio to you today if it were not for them. I am so grateful that Turing encourages the Mentor/Mentee Relationship. It has meant the world to me and I am sure it will continue to be important to me as I move forward. I am excited for the day when I can be a mentor to a Turing student... it will be an honor.
